# Robinhood

## Overview and Origin
---
The company was incorporated on April 18,2013. Founded by Baiju Bhatt and Vladamir Tenev. The idea of Robinhood came to the two founders when they moved to New York City and realized big Wall Street firms were paying next-to nothing on trades, while Americans were being charged commision for every single trade.

Robinhood makes revenue by rebates from market makers and trading revenues,stock loan, income generated from cash,cash management, and Robinhood Gold (a paid suite of powerful investing tools).

## Business Activities:
---
Robinhood is trying to make financial markets easily accesible for everyone. They are taking this approach by making "investing friendly, approachable, and understandable for newcomers and experts alike".
The company's intended customer is anyone and everyone who wants to get into financial markets, The biggest solution Robinhood offered was the pioneering of 0% trading commissions. This was a very unfair advantage that Robinhood started, but due to Robinhood shifting towards 0% commisions, most trading platforms had to follow in pursuit to stay competitive. 
Some of the technologies they are currently using are:

-python
-Sass
-Github
-swift

## Landscape:
Robinhood is in the FinTech domain. Some of the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years are digital payments, money transfers, alternative lending, and digital assets. Some examples of major companies within the FinTech space are Plaid, Square, and Coinbase.

## Results

Compared to competitors within the FinTech space, Robinhood was ranked #3 on Forbes Top 11 Biggest FinTech company with a $5.6 billion-dollar valuation.

## Recommendations
If I were to advise Robinhood on some products or services would be what TD Ameritrade offers with an interactive paper trading platform (Think or swim) to teach users more about financial markets. I think offering this service would benefit the company, by giving new traders more knowledge on how to trade on a deeper level. Robinhood cause also follow others suit by having extended hours as the likes of webull. The technologies this additional product would utilize is real-time data streaming, charting, stock scanners. These technologies are appropriate for my solution because it would help traders learn more about how the stock market moves, set-ups for placing a trade, and longer trading hours.
